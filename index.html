          <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
          <p>
            We are most familiar with the accomplishments of
            <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam</b>
            as a defence scientist. As a result of it, the alliance of N. D. A.
            government made him the contender for the post of leader of India in
            2002. With about 90% vote, he swore as the eleventh president of
            India on 25 July 2002 in Parliament within sight of Prime Minister
            Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his bureau of ministers. Sir Abdul Kalam
            was a vegan and carefully followed discipline throughout his life.
            Even though he didn’t have connections with a political field, he
            was politically productive on account of his idea of patriotism and
            his devotion towards open government assistance. He has been the
            central President who has never had any association with legislative
            issues or political exercises. In his few books, Kalam Sir has
            explained how he turned into the president of India. Through this
            book, he has explained numerous occasions that happened with him
            turning into the president. This book recommends that he again
            wanted to be the president of India. However, the conditions didn’t
            permit him to do as such. By going through his books, we can easily
            understand the thought of his interest and ability recorded as a
            hard copy.
